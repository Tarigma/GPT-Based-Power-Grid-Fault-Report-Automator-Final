## Introduction

The Power Grid Fault Report Automator is a powerful tool developed using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model that automates the process of generating fault reports for power grid incidents. As an electrical engineer or a power grid operator, writing detailed reports can be time-consuming and tedious. This project aims to streamline the report generation process by leveraging the capabilities of AI to assist in creating accurate and comprehensive fault reports.

## Features

- **Automated Fault Report Generation**: The automator can quickly generate detailed fault reports, including the cause of the fault, its impact, and possible recommendations.

- **Time-Saving**: Reduce the time and effort required to write fault reports manually, allowing engineers to focus on addressing the underlying issues.

- **Customizable**: The system can be customized to adapt to specific power grid configurations and incident types.

- **Natural Language Generation**: Utilizing the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, the automator generates reports in natural language for easy comprehension.

## How it Works

The Power Grid Fault Report Automator utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, a state-of-the-art language model, to generate the fault reports. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of power grid incidents and their corresponding reports, enabling it to understand the context and provide meaningful responses.

The process of report generation involves:

1. Receiving input data: The automator takes input data about the power grid incident, including details such as the location, time, magnitude of the fault, and any available sensor data.

2. Sending the prompt: The input data is transformed into a prompt and sent to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model via OpenAI's API.

3. Report generation: The model processes the prompt and generates a comprehensive fault report, including the root cause analysis, impact assessment, and recommendations for mitigation.

4. Presenting the output: The generated report is presented to the user, who can further review, edit, and finalize the report.

## Requirements

To use the Power Grid Fault Report Automator, you'll need the following:

- java 16
- OpenAI API credentials (to access the GPT-3.5 Turbo model) or you can change model in code and use free api key
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (can be installed via pip)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/power-grid-fault-report-automator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd power-grid-fault-report-automator`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Obtain your OpenAI API credentials and set them up as environment variables or within the project code.

2. Modify the configuration: Adjust the model settings and prompts to suit your needs.

3. Run the automator: Execute the main script to generate the fault report based on the input data.

4. Review and finalize: Review the generated report, make any necessary edits, and finalize the document for submission.

## Example

```java
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.Map;

@RestController
public class PowerGridFaultReportController {

    // Inject the OpenAIService dependency (you need to have this service configured and set up)
    private OpenAIService openAIService;

    // Constructor injection for OpenAIService
    public PowerGridFaultReportController(OpenAIService openAIService) {
        this.openAIService = openAIService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/generateText")
    public ResponseEntity<String> generateText(@RequestBody Map<String, String> prompt) {
        try {
            // Use the OpenAIService to generate text from the OpenAI API
            String openAIResponse = openAIService.generateText(prompt.get("prompt"));

            // Process the OpenAI API response as needed
            String processedResponse = processResponse(openAIResponse);

            // Return the processed response
            return new ResponseEntity<>(processedResponse, HttpStatus.OK);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>(null, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        }
    }

    // A placeholder method for processing the OpenAI API response
    private String processResponse(String response) {
        // You can add your custom processing logic here if needed
        return response;
    }
}
```
